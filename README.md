## Overview
This project is a 3D game environment developed using OpenGL, providing players with an immersive experience of flying a plane through a dynamic landscape of buildings. The game features interactive controls for navigating the plane, realistic rendering of the environment, and engaging gameplay elements.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenGL**: Utilized for rendering 3D graphics, allowing for the creation of complex shapes and dynamic scenes.
- **GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)**: Used for window management and handling user input, providing essential functionality for developing interactive applications.
- **C/C++**: The primary programming languages used for implementing the game logic and rendering pipeline.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes to the project codebase and collaborating with team members.

## Features
- **Plane Rendering**: The game utilizes various OpenGL functions to create different components of the plane, including the main body, wings, boosters, and other details.
- **Dynamic Environment Generation**: The environment is generated dynamically, combining ground and buildings to create a realistic landscape. Buildings are represented by torus shapes positioned at specific coordinates.
- **Interactive Controls**: Players can control the plane's position and orientation using transformation operations like translation and rotation. Key bindings enable movement in different directions (up, down, left, right) and zooming capabilities.
- **Smooth Animation**: Smooth animation effects are achieved by updating the position and orientation of the plane and environment based on user input or predefined logic. Rotation values and speed are controlled to ensure seamless movement.
- **Multiple Houses Rendering**: The game can render multiple houses in a row, creating a building complex. Each house is represented by a basic cube shape with additional smaller cubes for windows and other details.
- **Real-time Updates**: The game environment updates in real-time based on user input and elapsed time, providing a dynamic and interactive experience for players.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-directory`
3. Compile the source code using a compatible compiler for OpenGL.
4. Run the executable file generated after compilation.

## Usage
- Upon running the executable, the game starts with the plane positioned in the main menu.
- Use the following controls to interact with the game:
  - `w`: Move up
  - `a`: Move left
  - `s`: Move down
  - `d`: Move right
  - `z`: Zoom in
  - `Z`: Zoom out
- Once the game starts, navigate the plane through the landscape of buildings while avoiding collisions.
- Enjoy the immersive 3D gaming experience!
